# 30DaysOfCode - HackerRank
A repository to write code for 30 days to keep myself consistent & accountable.

All the code here is in C++

**Days**

[Day 0](days/day-0.md)

[Day 1](days/day-1.md)

This is not meant for cheating. This is to just put all the code in one place.

If you need any help raise an issue and I will try to answer that.

Hope You understand something new here.

*Happy Coding :blush:*
